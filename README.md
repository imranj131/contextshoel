## What the Quantified Self needs now is context

Contextshoel is a dashboard to track, a tool to understand, and a shoe to quantify your daily activity.

Tracking and monitoring data indeed gives some interesting results, and this basically leads up to the Quantified Self. But wouldnâ€™t it be better to analyse the reasons behind the change in patterns? Data by itself is good, but it is incomplete. What the Quantified Self movement now needs is the presence of Context.

Gathering data from the surroundings, and applying them in a creative and visually appealing manner, has been the norm of tracking for quite some time. With the advent of wearable devices, it has become even more simple and accurate to monitor the fitness stats more effectively.


Context does not require new data: it uses the data already collected from various sensors to draw valuable conclusions, humanize them, and present them to us in an informative format.


        For every event that occurs, there are a multitude of possible causes, and the extent to which each contributes to the event is not clear, not even after the fact!
